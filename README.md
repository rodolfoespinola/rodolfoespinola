# Hello there! 👋

I'm an aspiring full stack developer at the beginning of my journey in web development. Right now, I'm learning **HTML** and the basics of building web pages as part of the **Full Stack Developer** certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

💡 Why tech?
I come from a background in **journalism** and **visual communication**, and I'm now diving into technology as a new way to create, build meaningful tools, and solve real-world problems.

🎯 Goal: Become a full stack developer with a focus on **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, and **AI-powered APIs**, aiming for opportunities in Europe or remote work.

📚 Currently:
- Learning HTML and how the web works
- Practicing daily and building simple projects
- Developing a strong foundation before moving on to CSS and JavaScript

🌱 Next steps:
- Continue with the freeCodeCamp full stack path
- Learn CSS and responsive design
- Start building and sharing personal projects

🛠️ Tools I'm starting with:
`HTML` `Visual Studio Code` `GitHub`
