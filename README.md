# Hello, and welcome.

After many years working in journalism and visual communication, I’m now fully focused on building a new career in **cybersecurity and cloud computing**.

Technology has always interested me — not just as a tool, but as a language. Today, I’m learning to speak that language fluently to contribute to secure, resilient, and ethical digital systems.

## Why cybersecurity?

Because I believe the integrity of our digital environment matters. I’m drawn to the responsibility of protecting systems, data, and people — and I’m deeply motivated by the opportunity to solve real-world problems, not only with technical skill, but also with clarity, strategy and care.

## What I’m working on

- Completing the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**
- Studying for the **ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** and **Microsoft SC-900**
- Practicing hands-on skills daily on platforms like **TryHackMe**
- Building a portfolio of notes, labs and writeups here on GitHub
- Learning **Linux**, **networking fundamentals**, **SIEM tools**, and **incident response**
- Improving my French (A2) for opportunities in Luxembourg and across Europe

## My goal

To become a skilled and reliable **SOC Analyst** or **Cloud Security Technician**, contributing to a professional team where I can grow, keep learning, and make a difference.

## What I bring

- A strong foundation in research, communication, and critical thinking  
- A disciplined learning mindset, with 30+ hours/week of dedicated study  
- Deep motivation for meaningful, long-term work in the cybersecurity field  

## Tools and topics I’m exploring

`Linux` `Wireshark` `Splunk` `Kali Linux` `Python` `Azure` `GitHub`  
`Incident Response` `Cloud Security` `Threat Modeling`
